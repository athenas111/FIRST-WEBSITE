# FIRST-WEBSITE
i dont have too much to say about it. i did a little sketch and transformed it in FIGMA layout, and now im trying to transform it into a responsive website. My focus this time is to show that i can use creativity and solve problems (this case just creating a site where u can buy everything from Jimin) in the same project
